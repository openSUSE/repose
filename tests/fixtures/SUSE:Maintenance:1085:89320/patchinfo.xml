This update provides KIWI v5.06.195, which brings several fixes and enhancements:

- Follow up fix for Rename SLE JeOS descriptions: Fixed merge conflict to fit
  schema of this kiwi version. (bsc#959713)

- Rename SLE JeOS descriptions: In order to avoid a naming conflict with the JeOS
  product we agreed on renaming the SLE JeOS description in kiwi to contain the
  community keyword to separate this descriptions from the SUSE JeOS product.
  (fate#319430)

- Add root filesystem label to images: To allow devicepersistency="by-label" also
  for the root filesystem, the setupFilesystem method has been extended for all
  supported filesystems to add a root label too. The default name for the root
  label is 'ROOT'. (bsc#946236)

- Make sure kiwi_BootPart variable is written: kiwi_BootPart is expected to exist
  in the initrd environment. Thus it's required to write it in config.partids in
  any case. If there is no extra boot partition kiwi_BootPart equals kiwi_RootPart.
  (bsc#946387)

- Embed LOADER_TYPE into double quotes: This is required by perl-bootloader.
  (bsc#944017)

- Fixed setup of /var/run location: /var/run is a symbolic link to /run on newer
  systems and a directory on older systems. Handle this difference properly.

- Renamed bootloader ziplgrub to grub2_s390x_emu: We don't want to populate a
  non-existing bootloader. Thus the decision was to use the grub2 platform name
  for the SLE-12 s390x boot workflow. (bsc#944017)

- Added required packages to SLE-12 s390x images: grub2 and grub2-s390x-emu for
  vmx|oem boot images; grub2, grub2-s390x-emu and kexec-tools for JeOS templates.
  Additionally, extend JeOS template with some useful tools (parted, ip, less).

- Implemented support for stacked zipl plus grub2 boot: In SLE-12, zipl and btrfs
  are incompatible because the block where the initrd and the kernel live could
  change in a btrfs filesystem. To work with btrfs, a new boot process has been
  invented by the SLES team which impacts kiwi too.

- Fixed zipl setup: zipl does not allow a targetgeometry if the target type is
  different from CDL or LDL.

- Fixed diskOffset calculation for s390: zipl wants the number of blocks to indicate
  the start of the first partition, not the number of tracks.

- Fixed zipl installation for LDL/CDL on loop device: Installing zipl on the LDL/CDL
  target device types requires to specify the disk geometry. zipl is not able to get
  that information from a loop device. Therefore we need to hand over a targetgeometry
  which matches the loop geometry.

- Update selector for partitioner tool: If we are building a dasd image using the new
  loop driver which supports 4k devices, we need a way to select fdasd as partitioner
  on s390. This can be done via commandline options but is now also auto selected if
  a zipl_targettype of CDL or LDL is specified.

- Implement setup of loop logical sector size: The new loop driver capability allows
  to set a custom blocksize on setup of the loop device. The attribute value from the
  target_blocksize attribute is used in losetup as follows: "-L target_blocksize".
  (bsc#931634)

- Fixed zipl installBootLoader blocksize usage: There is now the target_blocksize
  attribute which is used. If not specified the default blocksize of 512 bytes applies.
  (bsc#931634)

- Fixed zipl installBootLoader blocksize retrieval: In order to find the target blocksize
  for the zipl configuration kiwi asked for the physical blocksize. However the logical
  block size should be used when zipl accesses the device. (bsc#931634)

- Added target_blocksize attribute in type section: In preparation to support custom
  blocksize values for loops the attribute target_blocksize was implemented like the
  following example shows: &lt;type ... target_blocksize="4096"/&gt;.  This will set
  a 4k blocksize used for all loops setup during image build and on first boot of the
  image. (bsc#931634)

- Deleted fixed parmfile name PARM-S11 on s390: Instead a new OEM element called:
  &lt;oem-vmcp-parmfile&gt; has been added. Using this element allows to specify the
  parmfile name without the userid. The userid is queried on demand. If no parmfile
  name is specified the default name PARM-S11 applies for backward compatibility.
  (bsc#931436)

- Fixed loading of vmcp on s390: In SLE12 vmcp is compiled into the kernel, thus loading
  it as a module will cause an exception which is misleading. (bsc#931436)
