HOSTS HOST operands have the following syntax:

     repose uses ssh(1) to access remote machines.  "ssh user@hostname" must work without prompting for any passwords
     or passphrases.

PRODUCT NAMES repose assumes product names as specified in repoq(1).

REPOSITORY NAMES repose assumes repository names as defined in repoq(1).

REPOSITORY PATTERNS Repository patterns accepted by repose are a
variation on repoq(1) repository patterns:

::

       [P][:[V][:[A][:[T]]]]

     Empty segments are treated as wildcards or default to information gleaned from /etc/products.d/baseproduct,
     depending on context.  Some useful variants:

       ·   P:V:A:T
       ·   P:V:A
       ·   P:V
       ·   P:V::T
       ·   P:::T
       ·   :::T
